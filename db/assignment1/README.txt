(Q9) The data issue identified in Q8 was that some sites have a nonzero reading count that deviates significantly from the norm. In a healthy dataset, we expect that each site's aggregated power readings will have a roughly similar number of nonzero values because the meters are supposed to report data consistently every 15 minutes. However, when a site has too few or too many nonzero readings, it indicates a problem. In my Q8 query, I computed the number of nonzero readings per site and then calculated the overall average and standard deviation from the mean. The use of the standard deviation here in the magic number and it was chosen based on the observed distribution of the data to isolate roughly the five sites with clear deviation from the norm. These issues were not caught by the "data gap" check in Q6 because that check only looked at the time intervals between consecutive data points. Q6 focuses solely on the completeness of the time series data, not the quality of the meters values themselves. 

(Q11) Based on the results regression results from Q11, our model produced a negative correlation coefficient. This suggests that as the age of the building increases, its weekly EUI tends to decrease. In other words, older buildings in our dataset appear to be more energy efficient than newer ones. Additionally, the moderate negative correlation suggests that while there is a noticeable trend, other factors beyond age likely play a significant role in a buildings energy usage. A more comprehensive analysis over a longer time period would be needed to validate this finding.
